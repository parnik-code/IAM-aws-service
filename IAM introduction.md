# This is about the IAM role in AWS.
# IAM: Manage access to AWS resources. In this we make sub admin or make accounts for my team and give access to them what I want to give, they can not access any other things or they do not have other permission like root user.
In this we can make different users and different groups we can attach the permission. we can add users to different groups and same user to different groups
In this we can create any policy according to my role. we can manage or manipulate all the policy which I made in IAM group
User can only get or add max 10 policy but group can do many
